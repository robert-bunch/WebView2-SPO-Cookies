# SharePoint Online - Get FedAuth And Rtfa Cookie
This is a sample/test project that demonstrates how to grab the FedAuth And Rtfa cookies from a WebBrowser Control embedded in a WinForms app, so that you can make subsequent programmatic http calls to Sharepoint using those credentials. 
This project is an updated version of https://github.com/OceanAirdrop/SharePointOnlineGetFedAuthAndRtfaCookie to use WebView2 for Edge Browser instead of IE.
